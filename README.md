# Sparse Principal Component Analysis (Sparse PCA)

Sparse Principal Component Analysis (Sparse PCA) is an advanced machine learning technique that combines the power of dimensionality reduction with the interpretability of sparsity. Unlike traditional PCA, Sparse PCA generates components that are sparse, meaning they depend only on a subset of the original features. This makes Sparse PCA particularly useful for feature selection and data interpretation.

## üåü Key Features

- **Sparsity**: Identifies only the most relevant features in the data.
- **Interpretability**: Enhances the clarity of results by focusing on fewer variables.
- **Flexibility**: Allows customization of sparsity levels via regularization parameters.
- **Robust Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces data complexity while retaining essential information.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

Sparse PCA minimizes the reconstruction error with sparsity constraints on the principal components. The optimization problem can be formulated as:

$$
\min_{W, H} \left\Vert X - W H^T \right\Vert_F^2 + \alpha \left\Vert H \right\Vert_1 + \beta \left\Vert H\right\Vert_2^2
$$

Where:

- $X$: Input data matrix.
- $W$: Principal components matrix.
- $H$: Sparse loadings matrix.
- $\alpha$: Controls sparsity (L1 regularization).
- $\beta$: Controls smoothness (L2 regularization).

The algorithm alternates between:

1. Fixing $H$ to optimize $W$.
2. Fixing $W$ to optimize $H$ using Elastic Net regularization.
